# Wine Dashboard Proposal
Authors: Ashwin Babu

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
**My role:** Data Scientist

*Target audience:* Wine Enthusiasts

The wine industry is vast and it can be difficult for wine enthusiasts to find the best wines to suit their tastes. According to Wine Institute, wine sales in the US reached a record high of $47.8 billion in 2019. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming for wine enthusiasts to decide which wines to try. This dashboard aims to provide wine enthusiasts with a user-friendly platform to help them find the best wines for their palate.

## Section 2: Description of the Data

I am using the Wine Reviews Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes wine reviews from around the world and includes information about the wine variety, the winery, the region where the wine is produced, the price, and the points awarded to the wine by the reviewer. The dataset includes 280,000 wine reviews and is updated regularly.

## Section 3: Research Questions

Our target user, Tanmay, is a wine enthusiast who is looking to discover new wines to try. He is interested in finding high-quality wines within his budget. He can input his preferred wine variety and region of production in the dropdown lists to filter the data. Tanmay can then see a world map that shows the number of wines coming from different countries in the dataset. This will help him identify the countries that produce the highest number of wines and potentially find new and exciting options. He can also view the price distribution of the wines he is interested in by selecting the province and wine variety. This will help him find high-quality wines within his budget. Finally, Tanmay can view a bar chart that shows the percentage of wines given the province selected. This will help him understand which provinces produce the highest quality wines.

In addition to Tanmay, the dashboard can be useful for wine enthusiasts who want to explore new wines and learn more about different regions and wine varieties. The dashboard can help them find high-quality wines within their budget and provide them with a user-friendly platform to explore the world of wine.
